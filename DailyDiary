Arrived at the library for 07:45.
Explored concepts for scratch project.
Drew out symbols for 5 x 7 matrix.
Ideas
-Make an Arithmetic Quiz Game
-Animate Characters by traslation, colour 
-design a BCD type of encoder relationship between ASCII table and the actual grid out characters.

Reading first 32 pages of the C rogramming book by Kalicharan.
Key points:

Define the problem.
Analyse the problem.
Develop an algorithm for solving the problem.
Write a complete program which implements the algorithm.
Test and debug the program
Document the program
Maintain the program

Make sure to test smaller sections in isolation (as with electronics).
Each activity should genrate/produce its own documantation.
